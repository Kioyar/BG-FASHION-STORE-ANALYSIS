### INTRODUCTION
I discovered this dataset during an online learning course and was truly impressed by its depth and richness. I've been eager to work with a comprehensive dataset like this to sharpen my skills in data cleaning, analysis, modeling, and visualization through hands-on practice.

#### PowerBi Concepts Applied
Data Modelling: Star Schema

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
- What is the total sales made in the year?
- Which city made most sales and which city made less sales?
- Total annual sales per selling area.
- Demostrate a critical awareness of the impact of data.
- Any other relevant data-driven insights into our sales.

### DATA SOURCING.
The data was obtained from an online learning platform (Utiva). I downloaded the CSV files and imported them into Power BI for cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
It contains 3 sheets/Tables.
- Competitive Territory with 11 rows and 2 columns.
- Names with 104 rows and 3 columns.
- Shop territory with 104 rows and 3 columns.

### DATA TRANSFORMATION / CLEANING.
The data was efficiently cleaned and transformed with the power query editor of PowerBi.

### Data Modelling

Power BI automatically established connections between the related tables, resulting in a star schema model. The "Competitive Territory" and "Shop Territory" tables are linked to the "Name" table through the shared columns "Territory" and "ShopID," respectively. In this model, the "Name" table serves as the fact table, while the remaining two tables act as dimension tables.
